                <h3> About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Initially an honors student at Georgian College, attaining a GPA of 90%, completing the Opticianry program, while specializing in business and entrepreneurship, and achieving a recommendation from the dean 4 semesters running, with glowing reviews from professors and classmates alike.

                    In 2019, I began learning game development as a hobby, and later expressed an interest in learning programming. My first game engine used Javascript so I began teaching myself from there with online tutorials, documentation, and youtube videos. Eventually I moved to a new engine that used Python based programming. Once again, moving to Unity, in late 2021, which specializes in C# based programming, which I personally prefer and have the most experience with.

                    Through my adventures as a hobby game developer, I learned how to use several programming languages, and eventually decided to go back to school, and pursue programming as a career. While I am still unsure of what path to take my programming experience I am open to all options before me and interested in learning all that I can to become a better programmer, and a better employee.
