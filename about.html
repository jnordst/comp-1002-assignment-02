                    <h3>I'm a Computer Programming Student at Georgian College, with 2 years of experience in
                        application and video game development. I'm very interested in learning more about HTML and CSS
                        while expanding my knowledge of programming as a whole. I'm excited to break into the industry
                        and work with you and many others on all of the exciting projects to come. </h4>

                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>
                    My programming journey all started when I finished playing a game called Octopath Traveler. I was so
                    inspired that I picked up a copy of RPG Maker to make my very own game styled after it. It didn't
                    take long to realize that you wouldn't get far in RPG Maker without learning how to make your own
                    features which drove to me learn Javascript, the language used by RPG Maker. I had became proficient
                    enough at it to even become a freelance developer, designing game features and plugins for other
                    game developers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I eventually begun wandering from game engine to game engine, and I loved learning the new languages
                    along the way. I've finally settled with Unity for now, but will likely be working in Unreal this
                    time next year, if the trend continues!
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a handful of new languages, some programming knowledge at my disposal, and having already made
                    money off my newfound hobby, I decided, "Why not pursue programming as a career?" Although I don't
                    intend on pursuing game development as a career, it was definitely the first major stepping stone of my new
                    journey as a devloper.

                <h3>App Development</h3>
                <p>
                    While I was working for Zehrs, I was constantly asked by customers "Which aisle is the stuffing mix
                    in?". For some reason, I could never remember this, so instead of just remembering it or writing it
                    down like a normal person, I went out of my way to learn application development and designed my
                    first app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lazehrs (lazy-zehrs) is a customer support application where anybody can edit and submit items to a
                    catalog. You can search the catalog tags or product descriptions (UPC, Article, Aisle etc) and if
                    somebody has already input information on that item it will show you the product page with all the
                    user-submitted information and shelf location, if not, you can submit it to the catalog yourself.
                    The premise is simple but could easily be expanded upon to include more stores from across the
                    world!
